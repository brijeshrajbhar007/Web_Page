# Web_Page
My webpage provided is a simple, personal webpage . It is written using HTML and CSS, which are common languages for building and styling web pages.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the structure of the webpage. It defines the different sections of the page, such as:

<header>: Contains the title ("Brijesh Rajbhar") and is designed to grab attention.
<nav>: A navigation menu with links to different sections of the page ("About Me," "Skills," "Contact").
<section>: Defines various content sections, such as the "About Me," "Skills," and "Contact" sections. These sections present important information about Brijesh's background, skills, and contact details.
<footer>: Contains the copyright information at the bottom of the page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style the webpage, giving it a clean and tech-savvy appearance. The colors and layout emphasize simplicity and professionalism:

Dark theme: The background color is dark gray (#1e1e1e), with white text (#fff), creating a modern and tech-focused look.
Header and footer: Both have a pure black background (#000), with the header text in electric blue (#00bfff), which is eye-catching and contrasts well with the dark background.
Navigation links: The links use a neon green color (#00ff00), adding to the tech-savvy style, and are spaced out evenly to make navigation easy.
Section backgrounds: The content sections are styled with a slightly lighter gray background (#2e2e2e) to differentiate them from the main page, with rounded corners for a modern feel.
Logic and Structure
Responsive Design: The page includes a <meta> tag that ensures it's responsive, adapting to various screen sizes by setting the viewport width to the device width.
Clear Content Structure: Each section of the webpage is focused on specific content areas (e.g., personal background, skills, contact information), making it easy to navigate.
Professional Details: The webpage highlights skills in programming, web development, communication, and project management, creating a well-rounded professional profile for potential employers or collaborators.
The webpage balances simplicity with modern design elements, focusing on presenting key information in a straightforward yet visually appealing way.
